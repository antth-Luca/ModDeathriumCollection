# Repository: Deathrium Collection
 
My second mod for Minecraft! It brings a collection of Death's relics and an ore that even Death fears... the Deathrium Ingot.

## Find it in this mod:
* Armor that makes you invulnerable, except to your fellow Deathrium Scythe;
* A scythe that applies hit-kill to anyone who is not properly protected;
* Seven Relics of Death:
    * Death Ring: Can be crafted. This ring gives you a 15% chance of kills dropping an Deathrium Ingot;
    * Death Cup: Can be crafted. This cup stores the soul of each kill and grants you 0.5 damage for each soul collected;
    * Lamentation Crown: Can be crafted. This crown increases your critical hits by 30%;
    * Black Heart: Can be found in the Nether Bridge chests. Heals you for 30% of all damage dealt;
    * Key to the Passage: Can be found in the Desert Pyramid chests. Increases your damage by 8% of your target's current health;
    * Reaper's Feather: Can be found in the Woodland Mansion chests. Allows you creative flight;
    * Bell of Last Words: Can be found in the Abandoned Mineshaft. If your target is left with 5% of their maximum life or less, they are killed.
